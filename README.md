This is a modification of a script written by @dClabby available here (https://github.com/dclabby/EirgridDashboardAnalysis) for the purposes of my 2025 leaving certificate project, an online version can be found here (https://csproject-y65a.onrender.com/).
This script can be used to download various sets of data from (smartgriddashboard.com) for analysis, including Co2Intesnity, System Demand, System Generation and Co2Emissions.
