# computerSciencerDownloadDashData
This is a modification of a script written by @dClabby available here (https://github.com/dclabby/EirgridDashboardAnalysis) for the purposes of my 2025 leaving certificate project, an online version of my entire project can be found here (https://csproject-y65a.onrender.com/).

This script can be used to download various sets of data from (smartgriddashboard.com) for analysis, including Co2Intesnity, System Demand, System Generation and Co2Emissions.
Please note that you may get blank responses if you query pre 2014, and if you set blocksize too large.
From my own testing a blocksize of 1 works if needed, aswell as 30.

Some responses may contain random junk data, so I recommmend throughly cleaning the data before analysis.
If you wish to change the daterange, feel free to do so within the download function.
